   <p> She is the wife of Peter McCallister and the mother of Kevin McCallister and 4 other children. She is a fashion designer. She is feisty, quick-tempered, humble, positive minded, protective, selfless, and many more. And sometimes, might even forget things - even her own child. </p>

<p> Marv and harry are tow burgulars who try to break into a house thinking its empty. But lil kevin gives them a run for they're money. They contribute to the comedy of the movie as they depiretly try to get into the house running into all sorts of traps the boy set up for them.</p>

<p>This is a gif that i made using Brush Ninja. It represnts the changing seasons and cycle of the seasons. It starts off with a beatful field of flowers that gets destroyed by a tornado and rain but then at the end a flower grows so it shows how after bad things good things will come. This was one of my favorite things to make and it was actually kind of hard at first but i obviously eventually got the hang of it. </p>
